# Vantage (Gophish Security Operations Hub)

**Vantage** is an advanced fork of **Gophish**, transformed into a unified Security Operations Hub. It acts as a powerful, asynchronous Go-based CLI wrapper and orchestrator for **ProjectDiscovery** tools, allowing security teams to manage phishing simulations alongside automated network scanning.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Unified Dashboard**: Manage phishing campaigns and security scans from a single modern UI.
*   **ProjectDiscovery CLI Wrapper**: Fully integrates and orchestrates ProjectDiscovery tools (**Nuclei**, **Subfinder**, **HTTPx**, **Naabu**, **DNSx**, **Katana**, **TLSx**, **ASNMap**, **Uncover**) as an asynchronous scan engine.
*   **Reverse L3 Tunneling**: Perform internal network scans through a secure Chisel-based reverse tunnel.
*   **Real-time Insights Discovery**: WebSocket-based live scan logs and campaign performance tracking.
*   **Enterprise-Ready Deployment**: Orchestrated via Docker Compose with Caddy (HTTPS) and Postfix integration.

## 🌐 Platform Architecture (Phishing & Scanning Workflows)

Vantage operates from a **VPS with a Static IP bound to a domain via DNS records** (essential for phishing/oltalama delivery). It supports three main workflows:

1. **External Scanning (Direct from VPS)**: Scans public internet assets directly from the VPS.
2. **Internal Scanning (Compromised Endpoint Simulation)**: Scans are routed from the VPS through a secure Chisel reverse tunnel (`tun0`) to the Vantage Agent running on a compromised endpoint inside the corporate network.
3. **Phishing Simulation**: Sends oltalama emails from the VPS to corporate users via Postfix SMTP, driving engagement tracking back to the dashboard.
