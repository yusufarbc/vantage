# setup.sh — One-command bootstrap for deploying Vantage with Docker Compose.
#
# Creates .env from .env.example if missing, fills in the values that have
# real security consequences if left at their defaults (admin path secret,
# basic-auth password hash, initial admin password), then builds and starts
# the stack.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/setup.sh      interactive prompts for domain/email/mail settings
#
# Re-running is safe: it never overwrites an existing .env value that's
# already been customized away from the .env.example default.
